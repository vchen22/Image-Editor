1. Name of PA: PA4: Image Editor

2. Description of PA: In this PA, I am manipulating an image by specifying
what edit functions I can do. I am able to manipulate an image with the help 
of the linear data structure called stack. Stacks keep note of all the edit
functions I do, which helps me navigate how I want to change an image
because I can retrieve previous data.

3. Features: In the Stack class, it has all the attributes on how to add
elements to a stack. It can check if its empty or full, see how many elements
are in the stack, what is the capacity, and add and remove elements in a
stack. All these attributes will help store the states of function calls in
the ImageEditor class. Image Editor can allow users to delete, blur, sharpen 
a pixel, undo and redo function calls, and get the image. The stack will 
take account of all the actions of user so it can undo or redo function calls.
